## WHY BID (Blockchain Identification) ?
In today’s digital world, Aadhaar and other government-issued identity documents are used widely for verification in hotels, malls, KYC processes, and online registrations. However, the Supreme Court of India has restricted the use of Aadhaar as the sole proof of identity due to increasing concerns about privacy, forgery, and misuse. The fragile and easily replicable nature of Aadhaar cards has led to numerous incidents where forged or illegally obtained Aadhaar data was used for malicious activities, including criminal impersonation and unauthorized access.
<br ><br >Example :- Whenever we go to a hotel, mall, or cinema, the only requirement is to show or submit an Aadhaar card, and based on that, anyone is permitted entry. Today, Aadhaar cards are very easy to forge, and there are numerous cases where Aadhaar cards have been falsified.
