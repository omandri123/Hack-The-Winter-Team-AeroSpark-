<br />Theme - Blockchain, IOT

## WHY BID (Blockchain Identification) ?
In today’s digital world, Aadhaar and other government-issued identity documents are used widely for verification in hotels, malls, KYC processes, and online registrations. However, the Supreme Court of India has restricted the use of Aadhaar as the sole proof of identity due to increasing concerns about privacy, forgery, and misuse. The fragile and easily replicable nature of Aadhaar cards has led to numerous incidents where forged or illegally obtained Aadhaar data was used for malicious activities, including criminal impersonation and unauthorized access.
<br ><br >Example :- Whenever we go to a hotel, mall, or cinema, the only requirement is to show or submit an Aadhaar card, and based on that, anyone is permitted entry. Today, Aadhaar cards are very easy to forge, and there are numerous cases where Aadhaar cards have been falsified.
## Cases of Aadhaar Card forgery

### We cannot be dependent on such weak identity protection.

## Government Action :
The Supreme Court of India has clarified that Aadhaar cannot be considered a definitive proof of attributes such as age or citizenship, and its use as a standalone identity document is limited to specific, legally authorized purposes. Despite this, Aadhaar continues to be widely used for verification in places like hotels, malls, and online portals, often without sufficient validation or authorization.

# What is BID (Blockchain Identification) ?

To address the issues of data privacy, forgery, and unreliable identity verification, the proposed system introduces a __Blockchain-based Identity Verification Platform (BID)__ — a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof digital identity network. The BID platform ensures that identity verification can occur without exposing or storing sensitive personal data in any centralized database.
<br /><br />The system functions as a trust layer between individuals and organizations (such as hotels, KYC agencies, or online portals) that require identity validation. Instead of repeatedly submitting personal documents like Aadhaar or PAN cards, users can register once on the BID platform and receive a unique Blockchain ID (BID) linked to their verified credentials.
